I am a Junior Researcher at the World Bank in the [ID4D team](https://id4d.worldbank.org/) and Lecturer in the Department of Economics at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú [(PUCP)](https://www.pucp.edu.pe/profesor/alexander-quispe-rojas). Currently, I collaborate with Professor [Victor Chernozhukov](https://www.victorchernozhukov.com/) on the creation of Econometric Packages and Tutorials about Causal Inference and Machine Learning (CI & ML).

I received my B.S. in Economics at PUCP and my M.S in Quantitative Economics at the University of Munich. During my second year, I visited the **Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard** ([LISH](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/alexander-quispe-rojas)). I worked as RA at Yale, the **Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition** ([MPI](https://www.ip.mpg.de/en/)) and **MIT Sloan**. 

## Current Projects about CI & ML

* [Dive into Causal Machine Learning](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/d2cml.ai/)
* Inference on Causal and Structural Parameters using ML and AI with [R](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/14.388_r), [Python](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/14.388_py), [Julia](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/14.388_jl) used in the course 14.38 at MIT.
* Machine Learning and Causal Inference using [Python](https://d2cml-ai.github.io/mgtecon634_py/md/intro.html), used in the course MGTECON-634 at Stanford.
* [HDMJL.jl](https://github.com/d2cml-ai/HDMjl.jl) - Julia Package of methods for estimation in high-dimensional models based on Chernozhukov et al. (2016)
* [Sensemakr.jl](https://github.com/d2cml-ai/Sensemakr.jl) - Julia package for sensitivity analysis tools based on Cinelli et al. (2020)
