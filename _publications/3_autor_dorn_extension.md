excerpt: 'During my time as Visiting Student at MIT, I took Labor Economics I with Josh Angrist and Daron Acemoglu. As my final project, I replicated and extended the analysis of Autor and Dorn (2013) using census data until 2015. I found that two patterns keep constant. First,  wages decline was particularly pronounced in machine operator and assemblers occupations among males. While for females, the decline was in precision production and craft occupations. Second, routine task-intensive labor markets saw rising earnings of noncollege workers in non-routine intensive occupations combined with declining wages in routine-intensive occupations.'
