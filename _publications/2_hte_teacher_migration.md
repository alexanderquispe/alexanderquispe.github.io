excerpt: 'In this paper, we build on Leon Perez (2019)’s results, who applied a matching
estimator to a geographic boundary discontinuity design to estimate the average
treatment effect (ATE) at the boundary, with 5-km half-bandwidth. In this context,
we aim to i) replicate Leon Perez (2019)’s findings using a variety of machine learning
techniques, ii) further identify heterogeneous treatment effects with additional
covariates given unconfoundedness, and iii) produce a geographic visualization of
the treatment and control schools with heterogeneous treatment effects.'
